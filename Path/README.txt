The game scene is /Assets/Scenes/MainGame.unity
Efficiency analysis is in ExperimentResult.pdf

A 3D path finding simulation game with:
- Randomly generated obstacles on the map
- Dynamically construct a reduced visibility graph for path finding
- Using A* algorithm to do the actual path finding on the reduced visibility graph
- Agents doing path finding have a replanning strategy to solve the situation where they interfere with each other
- Experimental information displays on screen for efficiency analysis
